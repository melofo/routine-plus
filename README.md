## Welcome to Routine+ !
Routine+ is an online platform for individuals or teams to organize daily/weekly/monthly routines by creating task boards with different columns and dragging and dropping the tasks between them. It features a beautiful drag-and-drop UI to allow a user to seamlessly manage their Tasks.

The application is a full-stack service that is built using the MERN stack and external libraries such as axios, mongoose, and react-beautiful-rnd.
