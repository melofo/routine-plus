## Comments

* **Presentation** (15/15) (all)\
This factor evaluates the team presentation, including how well-organized the presentation is, whether it covers the the important points of the project, the use of visuals, and the effectiveness of any product demonstration.

  * Positives
    * Super high-energy!
    * Good coverage of graphics design and consistency
    * Good presentation of communications within team
    * Good coverage of process incl. user stories
    * Good presentation of novel user model
  * Feedback
    * Might have been nice to hear from one or two other team members
      * provide more balanced in presentation
      * give other team members a chance to gain experience
    * Maybe a little less focus on "marketing"

* **Repository** (15/15) (Na and Abdul)
This factor evaluates the repository history, including whether the history of the development is reflected in the repository history, how branches were used, and the use of pull requests.
* Feedback
     * [x] Repository demonstrates good history with commits and branches
     * [x] Use Pull requests


* **Functionality** (15/15)  
This factor evaluates the functionality implemented by the product. 
  * [x]  the functionality provided matches the requirements documented in the product requirements specification
  * [x]  the implemenation of the functionality is adequate to support the intended use of the product
  * [x]  feature set provided seems reasonable for the size of the project team

* **Organization** (15/15) (Na and Abdul)
This factor evaluates the organization of the repository, including the structure of the repository and its contents, and whether the repository directories provide descriptions of the contents (e.g. with "README.md" files)
* Feedback
     * Clear separation of code and documents
     * Repository is well-structured


* **Methodology** (13/15)(YH)\
This factor evaluates evidence of applying the chosen methodology during the project. This includes communications, documentation of processes (e.g. backlog decisions, user stories, milestone tracking, issues), communications, and use of tools (e.g. GitHub project boards, issues, etc.).  
Your team choose the agile, which means you need to follow kanban/scrum framewrok, you lacked backlog and did not recorded issues by using the issue tool in git. And you'd better cut your development process into diffrent sprints. The good point is that you have milestone tracking and issues in your project board.
  *  Not enough documentation of processes
  * [x]  Use of tools 'project board' and 'wiki', but did not use tool 'issue'
  * [x]  Good communications

* **Code** (8/10) (Na and Abdul)\
This factor evaluates the project code to ensure that it follows good engineering practices, including the quality of the code, whether the code includes adequate documentation, whether any tests are provided for the code, whether there are scripts for building or packaging the code, and whether there is any external documentation describing the code, its organization, and how to build or deploy it.
* Feedback
     * Insufficient documentation to describe the code
     * No real unit testing of code

* **Documents** (15/15)(YH)  
This factor evaluates the external project documentation. Including: Project organization, Requirements, Features, Functionality interfaces/APIS, Design, Commumincation plans, Test plans.
  * Excellent external documentation!
    *  All the external documentation can be found easily in the docs folder and they are very organized, including very detailed Project organization, Requirements, Features, Functionality interfaces/APIS, Design, Commumincation plans, Test plans. 
    *  A clear link direct reader to all the documentation in readme
    *  Very beautiful readme file.
